# **VSD OpenLANE Physical Design Workshop using SKY130 PDK**
## Day 1 : Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and SKY130 PDK
### Introduction to RISC-V
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that is adopted in the world of computer architecture and processor design. It was originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley in 2010 and has since grown into a global collaboration of researchers and industry experts. The key characteristic of RISC-V is its simplicity and modularity. It follows the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) design philosophy, which emphasizes a small and streamlined set of instructions that are easy to decode and execute. RISC-V offers a base set of instructions, called the "RV32I," which provides essential operations for general-purpose computing. Additional optional instruction sets, such as RV32F for single-precision floating-point operations or RV64G for 64-bit computing, can be added to meet specific application requirements. One of the major advantages of RISC-V is its open nature. The ISA specifications, reference implementations, and software tools are freely available, allowing anyone to study, modify, or implement their own RISC-V processors without licensing fees or restrictions. This openness has fostered a vibrant ecosystem of hardware designers, software developers, and researchers who collaborate and innovate around the RISC-V architecture.

### How the software applications run on the hardware ?
All the software applications we use in our daily lives rely on hardware to run. The system software is responsible for translating the application program into binary language, which the hardware can understand and execute. The primary components of system software include the Operating System (OS), Compiler, and Assembler. The OS plays a crucial role in managing various aspects of the computer system. It provides an environment for the application program to run and handles tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, and input/output operations. Depending on the underlying architecture, such as MIPS, x86, x64, or RISC-V, the OS translates the application program into assembly language instructions. The compiler is responsible for converting high-level programming languages, like C or Java, into assembly-level language instructions. This translation process is influenced by the specific architecture on which the software will be executed. Different architectures have their own instruction sets, and the compiler ensures that the instructions generated are compatible with the targeted architecture. Once the code is in assembly language, the assembler comes into play. It takes the assembly code and translates it into binary code, which is a sequence of 0s and 1s that can be directly dumped into the hardware.

### Open-Source Digital ASIC Design

Designing Application Specific Integraded Circuits (ASICs) basically requires three elements : RTL IPs, EDA Tools and PDKs.

**RTL IPs**, or Register Transfer Level Intellectual Property, refer to pre-designed and pre-verified digital hardware components or blocks that are described at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). RTL is a hardware description language (HDL) representation of a digital circuit or a portion of a circuit. In the context of integrated circuit (IC) design, an IP refers to a reusable building block that can be integrated into a larger design. RTL IPs, specifically, are designed at the register transfer level, which represents the flow of data between registers and the operations performed on that data.These IPs can be licensed from IP vendors or developed in-house. They provide a level of abstraction that allows designers to focus on higher-level design aspects rather than implementing low-level details from scratch. RTL IPs offer various advantages, such as improved productivity, faster time-to-market, and increased design reliability. By using RTL IPs, designers can leverage optimized and well-tested building blocks, reducing the likelihood of errors and bugs. Additionally, using RTL IPs promotes design reuse, enabling designers to create complex systems by assembling and integrating different IP blocks.

**EDA (Electronic Design Automation) tools** are software applications used in the design, development, and analysis of electronic systems, including integrated circuits (ICs), printed circuit boards (PCBs), and other electronic components. These tools automate various tasks involved in the design process, increasing efficiency and reducing time-to-market.

**Process Design Kit (PDK)** is a set of files used within the semiconductor industry to model a fabrication process for the design tools used to design an integrated circuit.  PDK’s are often specific to a foundry, and may be subject to a non-disclosure agreement.  While most PDK’s are proprietary to a foundry, certain PDKs are opensource and entirely within the public domain.Traditionally, PDKs have been proprietary and provided by semiconductor foundries, limiting access and customization options for IC designers. However, open-source PDKs aim to promote collaboration, innovation, and accessibility by making the design kit freely available to the community. By providing an open-source PDK, designers can modify and customize the kit to suit their specific requirements. This flexibility allows for greater innovation, collaboration, and knowledge sharing within the design community. It also lowers the barriers to entry for new designers and encourages participation in the development of new ICs and electronic systems. Some of the  open-source PDKs are : SKY130, GFU180, ASAP7 etc
