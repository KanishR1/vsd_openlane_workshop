# **VSD OpenLANE Physical Design Workshop using SKY130 PDK**
## Day 1 : Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and SKY130 PDK
### Introduction to RISC-V
RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) that is adopted in the world of computer architecture and processor design. It was originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley in 2010 and has since grown into a global collaboration of researchers and industry experts. The key characteristic of RISC-V is its simplicity and modularity. It follows the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) design philosophy, which emphasizes a small and streamlined set of instructions that are easy to decode and execute. RISC-V offers a base set of instructions, called the "RV32I," which provides essential operations for general-purpose computing. Additional optional instruction sets, such as RV32F for single-precision floating-point operations or RV64G for 64-bit computing, can be added to meet specific application requirements. One of the major advantages of RISC-V is its open nature. The ISA specifications, reference implementations, and software tools are freely available, allowing anyone to study, modify, or implement their own RISC-V processors without licensing fees or restrictions. This openness has fostered a vibrant ecosystem of hardware designers, software developers, and researchers who collaborate and innovate around the RISC-V architecture.

### How the software applications run on the hardware ?
All the software applications we use in our daily lives rely on hardware to run. The system software is responsible for translating the application program into binary language, which the hardware can understand and execute. The primary components of system software include the Operating System (OS), Compiler, and Assembler. The OS plays a crucial role in managing various aspects of the computer system. It provides an environment for the application program to run and handles tasks such as memory management, process scheduling, and input/output operations. Depending on the underlying architecture, such as MIPS, x86, x64, or RISC-V, the OS translates the application program into assembly language instructions. The compiler is responsible for converting high-level programming languages, like C or Java, into assembly-level language instructions. This translation process is influenced by the specific architecture on which the software will be executed. Different architectures have their own instruction sets, and the compiler ensures that the instructions generated are compatible with the targeted architecture. Once the code is in assembly language, the assembler comes into play. It takes the assembly code and translates it into binary code, which is a sequence of 0s and 1s that can be directly dumped into the hardware.
